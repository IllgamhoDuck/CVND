    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** At CNN I used Resnet(The model that won ILSRVC & COCO 2015 competetition by Microsoft team) with transfer learning. Specifically it was resnet-50, one of the version of resnet. The input image need to be 3 * 224 * 224 size. For image captioning project I had to connect the EncoderCNN and DecoderRNN so after the resnet I added addition linear layer to transform the size of the output of the resnet to the embedding size(256) that can be directly feed to the DecoderRNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "At RNN, I used LSTM architecture. The input is a int datatype that indicates the index number of a specific word at a vocabulary dictionary. To feed this to LSTM, it need to be embedded size(256) so I used embedding layer to transform the input index(type int)to the embedding vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the LSTM it transforms the size embedding size(256) to hidden size(1024). \n",
    "\n",
    "The last layer is Linear layer that transforms the size hidden size(1024) to vocabulary size(approximate 9955). This is because it needs to classify to one of the vocabulary. So after the linear layer I added the log softmax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the architecture of CNN-RNN. Now for the values of the hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the GPU, I first tryed to train with \n",
    "\n",
    " ****FIRST ATTEMPT****\n",
    "\n",
    "- batch size = 128\n",
    "- vocab_threshold = 5\n",
    "- embedding size = 256\n",
    "- hidden size = 128\n",
    "- epoch = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned that the lower the batch size is the good the model will be trained. I choosed the batch size 128 because I wanted to train fast. At Vocab threshold I choose the 5 because I thought it would be more better to the model to understand the word that occurs at least few times. If I put every word even occurs 1 time, the model can misunderstand the use of the word and use it by accident. I was estimating the embedding layer size to 200 - 300 and because of I learned by experience and taught by mentor. 256 seems good size to me so I used it. I choosed hidden size 128 because I thought it would be enough. I have no guidance so I started with this values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After traing 2 epoch I found that model was underfitting. It was giving same captions for every single images. I realized that the model was too small so I tweak the values.\n",
    "\n",
    " ****SECOND ATTEMPT****\n",
    "\n",
    "- batch size = 32\n",
    "- vocab_threshold = 5\n",
    "- embedding size = 256\n",
    "- hidden size = 1024\n",
    "- epoch = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "I make batch size more smaller for better performance. And grow the hidden size to 1024. Hidden size is between 256 - hidden size - 9955. So I think it would be good to be between those two values(embedding size and vocabulary size). Except that I just left other values. \n",
    "\n",
    "After training 3 epoch the model was performing well. But not accurate for the half of the images. But still it was catching the context and just interpreting object bit silly(Say the sheep as a cow). I could know that if I grow up the model size and train more longer it would perform much better. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I lefted the provided value. For the model I need to give the image 224 * 224 size. But if I resize the image directly to 224 size the model cannot learn various images for the same caption. After resizing to 256 and random cropping to 224 will provide lots of different image for the same caption without loosing to much informations. Also it provides random horizontal flip. By cropping and flipping the model could learn by more various data and also preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "After tranforming the data structure to Tensor, it normalize the image with mean and varience. This makes the value range fixed and helps the model learn more efficiency because it doesn't need to try thinking about the relative size between the data(Some data might be too big and some data might be too small and need to consider about this if we don't normalize. For example, data 0.5 will have different meaning. For big image whose data is in range in 0 - 255 it will be a small number, but the image with 0 - 1, 0.5 has a size of medium number. Normalize helps unify each data dimension to single one).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the two main function with the transform, providing various images for one caption and normalizing to learn more efficient, I think this is a good choice for the CNN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I just select the the trainable parameters as provided upon. The whole RNN parameter and the embedding linear layer of CNN except the Resnet part. This is a good choice because resnet is well trained and the only thing to train is the other parameter that are not trained yet. This is a transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I selected SGD for the first time to train and found that the training speed was too slow. So I changed it to Adam, the best optimizer that has mixed the positive part of RMSProp/AdaGrad and Momentum. It trains the model well. I tried learning rate 0.01 and found that it divergence and the loss was between 2-3 and changed I changed the learning rate to 0.001 and it goes down to loss 1. But still doesn't go lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seems if I lower the learning rate like 0.0001 and make the model size bigger the model will go lower."

If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
